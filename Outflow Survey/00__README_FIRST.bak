Semi-automated IDL scripts. This procedure is first created by Fa-Cheng Li, and the specific steps of outflow survey see Li et al. 2018 (ApJS, 235, 15)

Note the file names, file paths, and basic parameters which are related to the data used to search for outflow.

First: Pretreatment:
	Try to divide the cube data into several parts. It is better that each part only contained a single velocity component.

Second: compile some functions that would be used in the following steps.
	1, mkoutflow.pro
	2, ident_outflow_test.pro
	3, findpeakpos.pro
	4, Lpeakv.pro

Third: preliminary outflow candidates
	1, Lpeakv.pro: the distribution of 13CO peak velocity;
	2, Uwingv.pro: the distribution of extensional velocities of blue and red line wings (note the threshold that related to the data used);
	3, Uwingvpeak.pro: the position of the minimum velocity extents (need installing starlink, note the parameters that related to the data used);
	4, wingdiagnosis.pro: line diagnoses of the positions of the minimum velocity extents (note the threshold that related to the data used);

Forth：manual check
  1, draw_outflows.pro: check each outflow candidates and adjust the position and the line wing velocity;	
  2, outflow_rank.pro: scoring system;
  3, bipolarcmp.pro: pair to form bipolar outflow candidates;

Fifth：calculation and outflow exhibition
	cal_area.pro: compile this one;
	cal_phy.pro: calculation physical parameters of each outflow candidates (note the threshold that related to the data used);
  download_wise.pro: download wise data from "http://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/current/cgi/query.pl" (need installing plugin skvbatch_wget.pl);
	out_figue.pro: plot outflow candidates.

Other related files used in above process: mkpvbelt.pro, crofits.pro.
